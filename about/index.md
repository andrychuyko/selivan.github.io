Hello, stranger!

My name is Pavel Selivanov. Here I write down notes on my Linux sysadmin/devops experience. Hope some of this will be helpful for you.

When I happen to create some probably useful stuff that is not under NDA, I put it on my [github](https://github.com/selivan).

This blog is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
