**UPD**: I created a feature request, asking for ansible guys to make special variable `ansible_role`: [#25447](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/25447).

**UPD 2**: @sivel noticed much easier way to do it: `{{ role_path | basename }}`. Seems that whatever you are trying to do, already there is a jinja filter to do it. `template: dest=/etc/mysql/my.cnf content="{{ 'mysql' | make_config_fast_reliable_and_secure }}"` :)

Ansible guys suppose to use `{% raw %}{{ ansible_managed }}{% endraw %}` inside templates to indicate where it came from. Unfortunately, this variable contains date and time, so it is changed on every playbook run. That breaks `--check` mode.

I prefer to include role name in template, so you can see where it came from. If you hard-code it, after refactoring that will become broken. Here is how you can generate it dynamicaly:

```
{% raw %}# Generated by ansible role: {{ role_path | regex_replace('^.*/([^/]+)$', '\\1') }}{% endraw %}
```
It's a bit clumsy, but it will never break.
